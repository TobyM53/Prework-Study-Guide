          <li>Checkout MDN Web Docs for more information about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>The (head) element contians information about the webpage, or metadata. .</li>
          <li>The (body) element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The (img) element contains information about imagines on the page, and the src tag defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The (br) element creates a break, or a line of empty space on the page.</li>
          <li>The (a) element stands for anchor and creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The (href) attribute points the anchor to a URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The (section) element is located in the body, they are semantic and contian thematic content. Thematic content represents chunks of narrative or story-like content.</li>
          <li>The (id) attribute is a way to identify elements and select them for use is CSS and JavaScript.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is how we add style to a page.</li>
          <li>The three types of CSS are: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
          <li>Seperation of Concerns refers to seperating code into different files based on use. It is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility. </li>
          <li>Work performed on CSS and JS happened inside the assets folder. Files were created inside the folder using the command line (touch) command.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and its value.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Use the (link) element with the (rel) and (href) attributes in the head section to add CSS pages.</li>
          <li>(Card) is a class selector and any element assigned to that class will gain it's properties. </li>
          <li>Color can be assigned with either the name of the color or with a hex number from the HTML color codes site.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A: add our changed files to the staging area of Git.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "note about changes": commits the changes.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: makes sure that our current branch is up to date.</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/branch-name: pushes the file up.</li>
          <li>When executing a PR (pull request) make sure the base branch is main and the comparison branch is the feature/branch-name.</li>
          <li>After creating a PR, merge the comparison branch into the base branch with the Merge PR button.</li>
          <li>Close any open issuses reguarding the PR.</li>
          <li>git check out main: returns you to the main branch.</li>
          <li>After pushing an update, make sure your local main branch is up to date. (git checkout main followed by git pull origin main)</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The script.js file is placed between the footer and the closing (body) element.</li>
          <li>A variable is a name container that allows us to store data in our code. </li>
          <li>An example of a variable is the (const) variable, which is a variable that can't be reassigned a value.</li>
          <li>The (console.log) method followed by an argument, which was topics in the study guide, will cause an output on the web console.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interuped with things like conditional statements and loops.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements (if) cause the computer to execute the action in curvy brackets if the statement is truthy.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A (for) loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types. </li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). The consle.log method will log the string in () after it is called.</li>
          <li>To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute.</li>
