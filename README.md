# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

I created this webpage as a study guide to help remember things I've learned during this prework lesson. The motivation behind this work was to take the first steps in a new journey, learning to code! Working through this webpage has helped greatly with the interface between git, the command line, and VS, as well as all the other information contained within.
